# Homework 1: Statistical Analysis with A/B Testing

This Jupyter notebook provides a comprehensive guide to A/B testing, Fisher’s exact test, and the chi-squared test within the context of statistical analysis. It is designed to help you understand the process of A/B testing, from formulating a hypothesis to analyzing data and making informed decisions.

## Overview

- **A/B Testing:** Learn the steps involved in A/B testing, including setting up the experiment, collecting data, and interpreting the results.
- **Fisher’s Exact Test:** Explore the mathematical derivation of formulas used in Fisher’s exact test and how to apply them to contingency tables.
- **Chi-Squared Test:** Understand how to implement the chi-squared test using Python code to determine the significance of observed differences in data.

## Key Themes

- Comparison of website design versions to determine which one performs better in terms of user engagement.
- Calculation of probabilities in contingency tables to analyze the results of A/B tests.
- Application of statistical tests to assess the significance of the differences observed in the data collected from different versions of a website.

## Getting Started

To get started, open the `Fisher_X2.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and follow the instructions provided. The notebook contains detailed explanations and Python code to guide you through the statistical analysis process.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of probability and statistics.
